<h2>SNOWPLOW LH 2 LLC PRIVACY NOTICE</h2>

<p>Snowplow LH 2 LLC and its affiliates (collectively, “Snowplow”) respect your concerns about privacy.  This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect on our website, <a href="www.252E57.com" target="_blank">www.252E57.com</a> (the “Site”), how we may use the information, with whom we may share it, the measures we take to safeguard the information, and how users can contact us about our privacy practices.</p>

<h2>Information We Obtain</h2>
<p>We may collect certain personal information about you on the Site, including contact information (such as name, email address and phone number) and other personal information contained in content you choose to submit on the Site. </p>
<p>In addition, when you visit the Site, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons.  The information collected in this manner may include IP addresses, operating systems type, browser type, domain and other system settings.  A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.  Through these automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website.  As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored.  Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our website.  Our Site is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers. </p>
<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as those of Google Analytics. These services help us analyze how users use the Site.  The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.  To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, you may visit <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>  </p>

<h2>How We Use The Information We Obtain</h2>
<p>We may use the information you provide to communicate with you; customize and send articles, promotional materials and other communications; operate, evaluate and improve our business; and comply with applicable law and our own policies and terms.  We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection. </p>
<p>We may use information obtained online through automated means for purposes such as administering the site and understanding the manner in which our visitors browse the Site.  </p>

<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described in this Privacy Notice.  We may share your personal information with service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions as well as with our subsidiaries and affiliates. </p>  
<p>We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.  We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or asset (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation). </p>

<h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>To update your preferences, ask us to remove your information from our mailing lists or submit a request, please contact us as indicated in the “How To Contact Us” section of this Privacy Notice.

Where provided by law, you may withdraw consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward. </p> 

<h2>Data Transfers</h2>
<p>We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to the United States and countries outside of the country in which the information originally was collected.  Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.  When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

<h2>How We Protect Personal Information</h2>
<p>We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.  </p>
